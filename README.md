# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in Swift when calling a function with incorrect argument types. The `calculateArea` function expects two `Double` arguments, but the example shows how passing a `String` as the second argument leads to a compilation error.  The solution shows how to correctly provide arguments of the expected type.
